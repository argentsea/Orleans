# ArgentSea Orleans Library

This library enables ArgentSea to server as a persistence provider for Microsoft Orleans.

This is an abstract implementation. Currently, there is an implementation for SQL Server. Using the same pattern, one could easily be created for PostgreSQL. Because this is abstract, you need not reference this package directly.
